# My Notion Journal

This script is for a personal need. It automates the creation of a daily journal in [Notion](https://notion.so), where each day a new page is generated. Any incomplete tasks from the previous day are automatically moved over to the new daily page.

## Features

- Creates a "Daily Journal" page in Notion every day.
- Migrates any unchecked tasks from the previous day's page to the new daily page.
- Runs daily via GitHub Actions for continuous automation.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (recommended version 14+)
- A **Notion Integration** with access to your workspace and the relevant parent page ID.

---

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a Notion Integration and Get Your API Key:**

   - Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations and create a new integration.
   - Save the **API Key** generated by Notion.

4. **Get the Parent Page ID:**

   - Open the Notion page you want to use as the parent in your browser.
   - Copy the ID from the URL after `notion.so/`, which should look like `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

5. **Create a `.env` File in the Root Directory:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Update the file with your API key and Parent Page ID.

   ```plaintext
   NOTION_API_KEY=placeholder
   PARENT_PAGE_ID=placeholder
   ```
